# Hibernate 

In this repository, I have covered the basics of Hibernate Annotations and CRUD operations using the Hibernate Session object. Hibernate Annotations provide a simple and convenient way to map Java classes to database tables, and define the properties of database columns. The Hibernate Session object provides methods for performing CRUD operations, which include Create, Read, Update, and Delete. To use the Session object, we first obtain an instance of the SessionFactory class, which creates and manages sessions. Once we have a Session object, we can use its methods to manage the persistence of entities in the database. The Session object also provides a cache for improving application performance. Overall, Hibernate is a powerful ORM framework that simplifies the process of working with databases in Java applications.
